# Team Planning Project

A lightweight space for our team to plan work, run sprints, and track decisions using GitHub Issues + Projects.

## Quick Links
- **Project board**: <add your GitHub Projects link>
- **Issues**: https://github.com/ORG/REPO/issues
- **Wiki/Docs**: /docs

## How We Plan
- We capture work as **Issues** using the Task template.
- Issues flow on a **Projects** board (board or table view).
- We work in **weekly/biweekly sprints**. Change the cadence here.

## Roles
- **Product/Lead:** <name> — sets priorities and accepts work.
