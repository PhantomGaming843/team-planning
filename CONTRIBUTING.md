# Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping! Here’s the simplest workflow we can all follow.

## Prereqs
- Git + GitHub account
- (Optional) GitHub Desktop if you prefer a GUI

## Branching
- Name branches like:
  - `feature/<short-title>-<issue#>`
  - `fix/<short-title>-<issue#>`

## Commit Messages
- Keep them short and clear. Example:
  - `feat: add calendar section to README (#42)`
  - `fix: correct project board link`

## Opening an Issue
- Use the **Task** or **Bug Report** template.
- Add labels for status + priority.

## Pull Requests
1. Link the Issue (e.g., `Closes #123`).
2. Fill in the PR checklist.
3. Request a reviewer (use CODEOWNERS defaults).
4. All checks green? Merge via **Squash & Merge**.

## Reviews — What to Check
- Scope matches Issue & acceptance criteria
- Clear tests/verification steps
- Docs updated if needed

## Project Hygiene
- Keep Issues small (<= 1–2 days work)
- Move cards across states during the week
- Close stale Issues (30 days)
